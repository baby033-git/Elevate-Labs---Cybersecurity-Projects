# Elevate-Labs---Cybersecurity-Projects
A Python tool that analyzes password strength and generates custom wordlists using user details. It checks complexity, calculates entropy, and creates attack-style dictionaries with leetspeak variations. Built to demonstrate password security and dictionary attack concepts.
# Password Strength Analyzer & Custom Wordlist Generator

This project analyzes password strength and generates a custom wordlist using user details.  
It checks password complexity, calculates entropy, and creates attack-style wordlists with
leetspeak variations. This demonstrates how weak passwords are exploited in dictionary attacks.
